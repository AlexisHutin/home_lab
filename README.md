# home_lab
## Overview

The primary objective of my home lab is to host various services independently, reducing reliance on cloud services, and fostering continuous learning through experimentation.
Setup

In my home lab setup, I utilize two main hardware components:

- Raspberry Pi: This device serves as the foundation for my home automation server running Home Assistant. It provides a lightweight and efficient platform for managing smart home devices and automations.

- Powerful Server: For more demanding tasks and services, I have a more robust server equipped with ample storage, considerable RAM, and a dedicated GPU for AI-related workloads. This server runs on Ubuntu Server as the operating system, providing a stable and versatile environment for hosting a wide range of services.

## Virtualization

To efficiently manage and deploy services within my home lab, I employ Docker for virtualization. Docker allows me to encapsulate each service into lightweight, portable containers, enabling easy deployment, scaling, and management across different hardware platforms.
Future Expansion

While my current setup meets my immediate needs, I'm continuously exploring opportunities for expansion and improvement. This includes experimenting with new services, optimizing resource allocation, and integrating emerging technologies to enhance the capabilities of my home lab.
